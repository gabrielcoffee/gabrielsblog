Hi, this marks the begginning of this digital journey for me.
It's not much but slowly I'll try to make something special out of this.
So why the title? What is it that I'm so afraid of?

Honestly sometimes even I **don't know**.

## Creativity and worrying

When you try to create something, if you are this type of person, I guess
everyone get to this point where they are just completely lost in their own
creation, not only in a "what do I do next" way but also in a 
*"is this just a complete nonsense, useless piece of shit?"* kind of thinking.

I wasn't always like this, I was someone who could create stuff without a
care, my best work was done when I had absolutely no worry in my mind.

I guess we all have been like this at least once, as kids.
Kids don't care, that's what makes them so creatively free.
There's no deadline, no one to impress or expectations to reach.

When did I lose that hability, to just immerse myself in my creation?
Or did I just forget that I can still do that? 
Not only me but **everyone can!**

I'm not sure where this is going, not sure where I'm going, but this,
this website, this text, this is me, trying again to be free, and I think 
it's working!

**How do I know that?**

Because these are the moments that I feel the best,
and right now, this little thing made me happy even if not 2 people
read it, I don't care! :D

So that's it, go on man, create that website, that game, song, business, 
create something new you are happy to work on, create something that makes you
feel something, because if not, well what are we even doing here?

## Coming soon...

I have some plans for the website and what I'm going to post here.
Nothing too big (for now) but if you enjoyed this text keep an eye.
Some album critiques, writing posts... the rest will be a surprise.

Thanks for reading!
